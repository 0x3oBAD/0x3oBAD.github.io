## 👋 Hello, I'm Abdullah Islam

I am a **Malware Analyst and Reverse Engineer** with a strong focus on **Windows internals, low-level programming, and offensive security research**.  
I enjoy dissecting complex binaries, understanding how malware operates under the hood, and breaking down obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.

My work revolves around **learning by practice** — reversing real-world samples, writing tooling to automate analysis, and continuously improving my understanding of how software behaves at the lowest levels.
